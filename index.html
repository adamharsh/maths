				<p><b>Latest Research</b></p>	
				<p class="normal"><b>Computational Biology(Source:MIT)</b></p>
				<p class="normal data">Computational biology and bioinformatics develop and apply techniques from applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics and chemistry to the study of biological problems, from molecular to macro-evolutionary. By drawing insights from biological systems, new directions in mathematics and other areas may emerge.</p><a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/applied/comp-biology.php">Read more</a>	<p class="normal"><b>Theoretical Computer Science(Source:MIT)</b></p>
				<p class="normal data">Theoretical computer science is a natural bridge between mathematics and computer science, and both fields have benefited from the connection. The field is very active, with exciting breakthroughs and intriguing challenges. The P =? NP problem is one of the seven of the Clay Millennium Problems. The recent polynomial time primality algorithm received a Clay Math research award.</p><a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/applied/comp-science-theory.php">Read more</a>
				<p class="normal"><b>Number Theory(Source:MIT)</b></p>
				<p class="normal data">The integers and prime numbers have fascinated people since ancient times. Recently, the field has seen huge advances. The resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles in 1995 touched off a flurry of related activity that continues unabated to the present, such as the recent solution by Khare and Wintenberger of Serre's conjecture on the relationship between mod p Galois representations and modular forms. .</p><a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/applied/comp-science-theory.php">Read more</a>

				<p >My Aim...</p>
				<p class="normal">I created this website to interact with mathematics in a very new manner
				Its being long time we have been studying using books notes etc and sticking to our academics.We didn't even tried to explore mathematics or we can say we didn't had time or thought of this. So I made this website so you can solve a brain teaser every day
				see what all researches are happening in the world and can be a port of that.With this site I want to provide a platform where everyone can come forward and enchance their knowladge.I aim to create a community where there is one GOD "MATHEMATICS" one religion "MATHEMATICS".Here everyone can put up their question and different editors can solve the problems.</p>
				<p class="normal">We also provide a blog service you can write blogs buts relavent to mathematics only and if you are working on a project you can interact with different people of same kind and can work efficiently with them.Hope you will enjoy learning.</p>
